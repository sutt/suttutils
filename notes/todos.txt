    walk_match():
    [x] convert the search util to a module
    [x] add some tests to util
    [x] add some docstrings
    
        bonus walk_match stuff:
        [ ] add a post-processing func to get the docs for it
        [ ] another way to do this is grepping through the directory

    other stuff:
    [ ] what else to add to utils? some eval functions

    [ ] how to make an instalable package

    [ ] how to manage exports, (e.g. like fastai)
        for intelllisense:
            from suttutils.utils import <os, sys, ... , walk_match, >
